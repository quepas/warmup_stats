This script is designed to be run with PyPy via a pipe.

It has been factored out because the code here is too slow to run on CPython,
and we need numpy as a dependency in related parts of the code base. Although
there is a version of numpy for PyPy, we wanted to reduce the number of
complications that arise for end-users.

It will read JSON format data from STDIN, and will write a comma-separated pair
of floats (mean, CI) on STDOUT.

Input data should be as per. the needs of the tables for the "main" warmup
experiment -- i.e. a list of pexecs, each containing a list of (steady state)
segments, each containing a list of floats.

Much of the code here comes from libkalibera.
